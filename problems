import py_structs as pys
import numpy as np
a = [i for i in range(10)]
a = np.asarray(a)
a = a.astype('float')
b = np.zeros(0, dtype='float')



PROBLEMS FACED:

1. if I declare variables in cython, I cannot call them to Python using the module
2. even inside the .pyx file, need to use global variable declaration
